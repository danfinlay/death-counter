Parses a death census CSV generated by [this parser](https://github.com/tommaho/VS13MORT.DUSMCPUB-Parser) from the `DUSMCPUB` census files found [here](http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data_access/vitalstatsonline.htm).

The causes of death for the cause codes found in that database were found in [this document](http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/dvs/Record_Layout_2014.pdf), and encoded in the file header.

To run this script, have `node.js` installed, run `npm install` in this folder, modify the `index.js` file to point to the `csv` file, and then run `npm start`.
